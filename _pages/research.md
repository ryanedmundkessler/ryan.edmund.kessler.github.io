### Do Driver's License Suspensions Compel Payment? Evidence From Chicago

*Abstract:* Many state and local governments use the threat of driver's license suspension to compel payment of fines and fees. In this paper, I provide the first quasi-experimental evidence on the efficacy of such threats. Using administrative records from the City of Chicago, I estimate the effect of the threat of driver's license suspension on the ex post receipt and payment of traffic fines. To isolate the causal effect of the threat, I exploit cross-sectional variation in exposure to a policy change that resulted in a ten-fold increase in driver's license suspension threats in the city in a difference-in-differences design. The threat of driver's license suspension has little effect on ex post ticket receipt but increases ticket payment by \$814 on average in the three years following receipt of the threat. The payment response is smaller among drivers with vehicles registered in high-poverty ZIP Codes. Eliminating driver's license suspensions for the non-payment of traffic fines would reduce annual traffic fine revenue in the city by at least 6.8 percent.

### The Effect of SNAP on the Composition of Purchased Foods: Evidence and Implications
with Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro

[Draft, June 2019](../files/snap_nutrition.pdf); [Appendix](../files/nutr_online.pdf); [Supplement](../files/snap_nutrition_hms.pdf); [Policy Brief](https://www.ripl.org/initiatives/initiative-two-social-program-innovation-2/initiative-two-snap-nutrition/)

*Abstract:* We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household’s food purchases to the household’s current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.

### Does Unemployment Insurance Stabilize the Housing Market? A Comment on Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018)

[Draft, January 2019](../files/hmm_comment.pdf)

*Abstract:* Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018) (HMM) study the effect of unemployment insurance (UI) on the housing market. Exploiting time-series variation in regular state UI generosity and cross-sectional variation in federal supplements to regular state UI generosity during the Great Recession, HMM find that UI reduces the likelihood of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure among the unemployed. In this comment, I show that both of these sources of variation in UI generosity are confounded by variation in state economic conditions. Taking account of state economic confounds reduces the magnitude of HMM’s headline estimates and renders them statistically indistinguishable from zero.
