## The effect of SNAP on the composition of purchased foods: Evidence and implications

June 2019

(with Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro)

[Draft](../files/paper1.pdf), [Appendix](../files/paper1.pdf), [Supplement](../files/paper1.pdf)

We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household’s food purchases to the household’s current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.
