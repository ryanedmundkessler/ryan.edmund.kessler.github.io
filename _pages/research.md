## The effect of SNAP on the composition of purchased foods: Evidence and implications

(with Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro)

[Draft, June 2019](../files/snap_nutrition.pdf); [Appendix](../files/nutr_online.pdf); [Supplement](../files/snap_nutrition_hms.pdf)

We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household’s food purchases to the household’s current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.

## Does Unemployment Insurance Stabilize the Housing Market? A comment on Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018)

[Draft, January 2019](../files/paper1.pdf)

Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018) (HMM) study the effect of unemployment insurance (UI) on the housing market. Exploiting time-series variation in regular state UI generosity and crosssectional variation in federal supplements to regular state UI generosity during the Great Recession, HMM find that UI reduces the likelihood of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure among
the unemployed. In this comment, I show that both of these sources of variation in UI generosity are confounded by variation in state economic conditions. Taking account of state economic confounds reduces the magnitude of HMM’s headline estimates and renders them statistically indistinguishable from zero.
