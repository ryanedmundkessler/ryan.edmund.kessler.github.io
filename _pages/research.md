### The Effect of SNAP on the Composition of Purchased Foods: Evidence and Implications
with Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro 
American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, Forthcoming 

[Draft, July 2020](../files/snap_nutrition.pdf); [Appendix](../files/nutr_online.pdf); [Policy Brief](https://www.ripl.org/initiatives/initiative-two-social-program-innovation-2/initiative-two-snap-nutrition/)

*Abstract:* We use detailed data from a large retail panel to study the effect of participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the composition and nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption. We find that the effect of SNAP participation is small relative to the cross-sectional variation in most of the outcomes we consider. Estimates from a model relating the composition of a household’s food purchases to the household’s current level of food spending imply that closing the gap in food spending between high- and low-SES households would not close the gap in summary measures of food healthfulness.

### Do Fines Cause Financial Distress? Evidence From Chicago

*Abstract:* This paper studies the effect of government fine and debt collection policy on individual financial well-being in the context of Chicago, where beginning in 2011 the city adopted a more aggressive traffic fine and debt collection policy. Using detailed traffic fine, credit report, and consumer bankruptcy records, I estimate that the policy change did not have a large effect on financial well-being as measured by credit scores, credit card balances past due, or debt in collections. The policy change did, however, cause a 1.1 standard deviation increase in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy rate, amounting to approximately 43,000 additional Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings through the end of 2017. The bankruptcy response was driven by an influx of filings by relatively low-income, low-asset individuals with significant traffic fine debt. For most Chapter 13 bankruptcy filers with traffic fine debt, bankruptcy provided no debt relief and limited asset protection at significant cost in bankruptcy court and attorney fees. These results highlight inefficiencies in revenue generation via fines.

### Does Punishment Compel Payment? Driver's License Suspensions and Fine Delinquency

[Draft, March 2020](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3545324)

*Abstract:* Many state and local governments use the threat of driver's license suspension (DLS) to compel the payment of fines and fees. In this paper, I provide the first quasi-experimental evidence on the efficacy of such threats. Using administrative records from the City of Chicago, I estimate the effect of receiving a threat of DLS on the payment of traffic fines. To isolate the causal effect of receiving a threat, I exploit cross-sectional variation in exposure to a change in the enforcement of DLS policy in a fuzzy difference-in-differences research design. Receiving a threat of DLS increases traffic fine payment by $658 on average over the four years following receipt, representing 40 percent of the average traffic fine debt among drivers in my sample. The effect is significantly smaller among drivers with vehicles registered to higher-poverty ZIP Codes. My estimates suggest that eliminating DLS for the non-payment of traffic fines would reduce annual traffic fine revenue in the city by 4.5 percent.  

### Does Unemployment Insurance Stabilize the Housing Market? A Comment on Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018)

[Draft, January 2019](../files/hmm_comment.pdf)

*Abstract:* Hsu, Matsa, and Melzer (2018) (HMM) study the effect of unemployment insurance (UI) on the housing market. Exploiting time-series variation in regular state UI generosity and cross-sectional variation in federal supplements to regular state UI generosity during the Great Recession, HMM find that UI reduces the likelihood of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure among the unemployed. In this comment, I show that both of these sources of variation in UI generosity are confounded by variation in state economic conditions. Taking account of state economic confounds reduces the magnitude of HMM’s headline estimates and renders them statistically indistinguishable from zero.
