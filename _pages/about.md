I'm a PhD student in economics at Brown University. I study topics in public and household finance. 

Prior to joining Brown, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I received a BA in Quantitative Economics from Drake University in 2010 and a MA in economics from Brown University in 2015.
