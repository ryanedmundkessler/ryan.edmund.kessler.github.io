I am an economist with interests in public finance and applied econometrics. 

I received a PhD in economics from Brown University in 2020. Prior to joining Brown, I worked as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I received a BA in quantitative economics from Drake University in 2010.
